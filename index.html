    <p> A ghost, though invisible, still is like a place <br>
your sight can knock on, echoing; but here <br>
within this thick black pelt, your strongest gaze <br> 
will be absorbed and utterly disappear: <br> <br>

just as a raving madman, when nothing else <br>
can ease him, charges into his dark night <br>
howling, pounds on the padded wall, and feels <br>
the rage being taken in and pacified.<br> <br>

She seems to hide all looks that have ever fallen <br>
into her, so that, like an audience, <br>
she can look them over, menacing and sullen, <br>
and curl to sleep with them. But all at once <br> <br>

as if awakened, she turns her face to yours; <br>
and with a shock, you see yourself, tiny, <br>
inside the golden amber of her eyeballs<br>
suspended, like a prehistoric fly.  </p>
