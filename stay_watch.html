    <p>You decide to STAY TO WATCH the movie that is playing in the theatre. You watch a man run into a dungeon, picking up a stick along the way and lighting it with the fire found on the torches that hang by the entrance. As he walks inside, he comes face to face with a fork in the cave -- he decides his path quickly as he turns towards the left tunnel. Suddenly wind blows in from the right tunnel and extinguishes his fire, his only light source. Despite this, he continues forward with his bare six senses, and as he walks further with each step into the tunnel, his path, as well as the movie... dims… an agonizing scream fills the room after several seconds, startling you. You didn’t notice that a man had approached you from behind… but was it a man?</p>
